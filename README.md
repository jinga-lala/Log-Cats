Problem


In this age of mobile phones, we are so deeply dependent on cellular connectivity that a momentary lapse can create a cause for panic. Whenever any region faces any natural calamity the first thing that get disrupted is the cellular connection between the mobile phones. This not only aggravates the panic among the masses but also make it difficult for the rescue team to save the lives of the stranded people.


Our Idea and Implementation Details


We propose to design and deploy an Android application which aims to tackle the problem of communication during disasters, mainly where usual cellular networks are affected.


The application will use WiFi-Direct to create a mesh network of nearby devices and communicate the GPS coordinates of each device to others, and point them to the location of a particular device. This is especially useful for rescue teams working to locate people in such a calamity. 


The mesh network also has the capability to broadcast the location of nearby devices to a larger area, because each phone can act as a beacon, and further propagate information to other devices it encounters.


Proposed Implementation


Future version


The platform can not only be used for communicating locations, but also for messaging without internet. The implementation for this feature is more involved, as it would require storing all messages encountered by the phone, and syncing the messages between various phones. Further, we can also make the application more secure by giving users greater control over whom to share their locations or messages with, though this may not be relevant to a disaster like situation.
