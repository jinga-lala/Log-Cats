## Problem

In this age of mobile phones, we are so deeply dependent on cellular connectivity that a
momentary lapse can create a cause for panic. Whenever any region faces any natural
calamity the first thing that get disrupted is the cellular connection between the mobile
phones. This not only aggravates the panic among the masses but also make it difficult for
the rescue team to save the lives of the stranded people.

## Our Idea and Implementation Details


* We propose to design and deploy an **Android application - Glimmer** which aims to
tackle the problem of communication during disasters, mainly where usual cellular
networks are affected.
* The application will use **WiFi-Direct** to create a mesh (peer-to-peer) network of
nearby devices and communicate the **GPS coordinates** of each device to others,
and point them to the location of a particular device. This is especially useful for
rescue teams working to locate people in such a calamity.
* The mesh network also has the capability to broadcast the location of nearby devices
to a larger area, because each phone can act as a beacon, and further propagate
information to other devices it encounters.
* In the User Interface, the app will give directions to other users to reach any
particular user thus making it useful in rescue activities.

## Future possibility

* The platform can not only be used for communicating locations, but also for
messaging without internet.These messages may include announcements made by
rescue teams, regarding aid etc., or communication between various people in order
to collate resources, or help each other out.
* The implementation for this feature is more involved, as it would require storing all
messages encountered by the phone, and syncing the messages between various
phones.
* Further, we can also make the application more secure by giving users greater
control over whom to share their locations or messages with, though this may not be
relevant to a disaster like situation.
